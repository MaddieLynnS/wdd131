When my sister and I were little, we loved to play Fireboy and Watergirl together on our family computer.
It didn't take too long before we beat every single game we could find, but there were no other free, two-player games
for us to play together. It was frustrating for us at the time and I still wish there were some simple free
computer games that younger kids could play together on one computer.
The other problem that video games introduce? Zoned out kids who don't know how to talk to each other.
This site exists to solve both problems!!
Here you'll find a few free games intended for two players. In between each turn, the players get a chance to discuss
a simple life question together (and strategize how to WIN when their turn comes...)



Things I'll need to pull off this site:
Home page with game images and short descriptions
    A row of categories that the questions can come from
    Home page logo
Games page with a search bar to search games
    Playable game of tictactoe in its own box
        Updating player number, tictactoe values, etc
    Playable game of hangman
        Set of pngs that will update depending on if the user guess is correct or not
JSON thing storing all the reflection questions
    Tags denoting which category they come from
    A question pops up after each player takes a turn in a game


DUE April 5th- not a lot of time to pull this off
    April 26th- skeleton built out (two pages, working links, etc)
