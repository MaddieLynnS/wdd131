			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site is to provide a fun, ad-free place for kids to play simple games and get to know each other better.
                This will be accomplished through a variety of simple two-player games that are interspersed with questions that the players
                can then discuss in between turns to learn more about the other player.
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My site audience is for younger kids ages 7-13 who often enjoy playing computer games but need something simple.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Javascript will do most of the heavy lifting for this site. There will be a simple search bar for finding games, which will filter
                out what games are shown. Javascript will also store the logic for the games and determine which game is being played. It will also
                select from the JSON file of different questions based on which category the players selected at the beginning of the game and pick
                one to show to the players in between turns.
            </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Noticia Text
                <!--I picked this font because to me it looks professional while still carrying an element of fun. The other font present in my logo is Koulen-->
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Lato
				<!-- I picked this font because it is the default and more importantly because I like the look of it -->
			</h4>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Content: Welcome to It Takes Two! Here you can play games with a friend and get to know them too! After every turn, you'll get
                a question to talk about that comes from a category you choose. Let the games and random conversations begin!
                Tic tac toe: The classic game of X's and O's! This game is harder to win than you'd think, but will entertain you for hours.
                Hangman: Can you guess the word before your friend? Careful, you can only make three mistakes before it's game over!
                More games coming soon!
            </p>

			<p>Content: Tic Tac Toe. Player 1, your turn! Player 2, your turn! Player 1/2 wins! It's a tie! etc.
                Questions will come from the "relection-questions.mjs" file

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				https://wireframe.cc/2eyRcQ
                I couldn't figure out how to get a screenshot of the whole thing so here is the link.
                The games may also have buttons that say "Play now" that will take them to their pages. There will be a few more
                game images that will show up in search thing, but will not be shown on this home page initially because they are 
                not playable. The categories at the bottom are meant only to represent types of questions- they are not clickable Here.
                The players will be shown the categories just before gameplay begins and can select the category then
			</p>

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				This is for the tic tac toe page, but the hangman page will look about the same. In between turns there will be a 
                brief overlay text box that will appear with a random question from the category pool that will not close until the 
                user selects the X button
